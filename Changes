0.18-alpha  12/12/01  - 1st Alpha, 
                      - added byte offset reading
                      - fixed bug where various types of FTP/HTTP transfer could screw up metadata
                        for reading some kinds of Delimited/Formatted IOStyles.

0.17-beta1  10/15/01  ~ 2nd Beta, Patch Level 2
                      - small fixes needed by FITSML

0.17-beta1  10/01/01  ~ 2nd Beta, Patch Level 1
                      - bug in reading external TaggedXMLDataIOStyle, DelimitedXMLDataIOStyle formatted files fixed
                      - added create tests for external data files to build.xml

0.17-beta1   9/24/01  ~ 2nd Beta
                      - Added BaseObjectWithXMLElements class. Array, Field, Structure, Axis
                        classes may now hold new XMLElements.
                      - Added ability to add an arbitary XML attribute (e.g. previously undeclared
                        attribute that isnt a part of the class in the DTD) to any class that
                        inherits from BaseObject.
                      - Re-added writeAxisOrder stuff to XMLDataIOStyle classes. Fixed write bug.
                      - Added XDF base object structure class. This class represents the top
                        level structure in an XDF object and (hopefully) clarifies some
                        confusion over the nature of structure objects in general.
                        As part of this change I did away with XMLNotationHash garbage and implemented
                        several new child classes for the XDF class: DocumentType, XMLDeclaration.
                      - Href class name changed to "Entity".
                      - Added get/set Long/Short Data methods in DataCube.
                      - Higher dimesional arrays not implemented correctly (!! in 3+ dimensions). Fixed.
                      - Added get/setIOAxesOrder in XMLDataIOStyle.
                      - Public add methods now uniformly return "boolean" rather than an object.
                      - Added compression/decompression support for GZIP, Zip (bzip2, UNIX "compress"
                        and Xmill still missing)
                      - Bug fix to valueGroup printing in toXMLOutputStream.
                      - Re-wrote toXMLOutputStream. Now using buffered writing. Faster.
                      - Added convience methods for populating axis, fieldAxis at construction time.
                      - further cleanup of deprecated classes from old xml-tr2 package. It should NOT
                        be needed at all now. Note that we are not making full use of namespaces (yet).
                      - Tightening of toXMLOutputstream method. Only XDF object may print notation hash,
                        DOCTYPE and xml decl statement.
                      - Added toXMLString method to BaseObject. All inheriting classes may now write
                        their XML representation string when called.
                      - Added class XML attribute to FieldGroup.
                      - Bug fix to allow integer data starting with "+" sign.
                      - Added ValueListAlgorithm, ValueListDelimitedList and ValueList(internal reader class)
                        to treat <valueList> nodes.
                      - Added XDF::DOM functionality. Any XML document may be read into this DOM which
                        contains convience methods for accessing/manipulation of the XDF element nodes.
                      - Support for correct output formatting under delimited and tagged data added.
                      - Better support for reading file href Entities that reside in different locations
                        from the metadata.
                      - Added CreateXdf.java program.
                      - Added More sample data incl. the currently unreadable bzip2 data style (XDF_sample10.xml).
                      - Improved error messaging. Throwing more exceptions as we should. Not optimal, but
                        better.
      
0.17-beta0_1 3/28/01  1st Beta, Patch level 1
                      - bug in BaseObject class that caused crash for certain toXMLOutputStream
                        calls (private field XMLNotationHash not properly declared). FIXED.

0.17-beta0  2/06/01  1st Beta. 
                     - Changed name of FixedDataFormat to FloatDataFormat. 
                     - Removed ExponentialDataFormat, functionality now in FloatDataFormat.
                     - Binary write data enabled.
                     - Octal/hex data read/write enabled.
                     - Changed internal code to more consistent use of constants. This 
                       should make us more able to meet changed in the DTD in the future and
                       lower errors.
                     - Jaxp compatiblity. SAX1 remains in use however.
                     - added setData methods for Double, Integer objects to DataCube and Array.
                       Fixed some of the internal logic (but still needs more work).
                     - Fixed bug in locator.hasNext method. Was droping last value in dataCube
                       from consideration.
                     - Added append array functionality.


0.17e       1/29/01  revision to 4th alpha version.
                     - Binary reading enabled
                     - Finally fess'd up to the fact that nobody uses Java-X package.
                       Code is now compliant with org.xml.sax.* classes. Download
                       jaxp (or other package) to get this functionality.
      

0.17d       1/23/01  4th alpha version.
                     - Fixed Errored Value to DTD standard. 
                     - Fixed some of ExponentialDataFormat. Exponents max
                       size cant be specified in Java, so some problems remain.
                     - Added ability to set the XML parser.
                     - Href attribute implemented properly in DataCube.
                     - Read id/idref fixed. Added id/idref stuff for value,
                       parameter and valueList as per DTD.
                     - fixed value valueIdRef attribute misspelling.
                     - valueList now may be used under parameter node.
                     - Array now directs child Locators to properly remove an axis
                       when it itself removes an axis.

0.17c      12/??/00  3rd alpha version.

0.17b      11/??/00  2nd alpha version.

0.17a      11/11/00  First alpha version. Delimited and Tagged ASCII
                     IO implemented. Formatted and Binary data IO 
      		     missing. Deep cloning *is* implemented. 

 0.01       9/15/00  Initial code/directory structure laid down and
                     Java project started.
