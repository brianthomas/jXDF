<h2>XDF Package Overview</h2>
<p>
The XDF (eXtensible Data Format) Java package comprises a "Core"
package which may be used to read/write/manipulate XDF objects/files
and several XDF::DOM packages which allow read/write/manipulation of
XML documents which embed one or more XDF elements. The XDF::DOM
packages are named according to the particular underlying DOM implementation 
that they inherit from. You do not need more than one of these XDF::DOM
packages in order to get the XDF::DOM functionality.
