   within this package:

        - binary data not implemented (!!).

        - Makefile is NOT nmake (the W32 make utility) ready. Must currently compile
          each class "by hand" ugh. 

        - Dropping relationship node/object after output fed thru parser a second time.
          (relationship node not implemented yet??).

        - Log configuration doesnt appear to allow writing to System.err.

        - The Java DecimalFormat code for exponential fields has unfortunate behavior.
          There can be no maximum exponent size specified, this means that the width of
          the exponential after being formated may exceed the specified dataFormat width.
          Our present 'solution' is to trim fields that are too big. An example of how this
          may happen: negative exponents in the exponential format. We need to implement
          by hand our own exponential formatter code to fix this. 

        - show we not allow repeatable attribute to apply to the recordterminator
          on string parsing (it only applies to delimiting characters right now;
          Question: how does the Perl package handle this?) 
   
        - Exponential formatting is *less than optimal* in Java. Using DecimalFormat
          results in rounding errors, for example, the following numbers:
          double data[] = { 1.01E-1, 3.001E5, -13.E-8, 1.021E3 };
	  using the following decimalFormat pattern: "#0.0E0;-0.0E0" 
	  print out as: .101E0, 30.0E4, -13E-8, 10.2E2

        - Treatment of XML comments (the stuff in an XML file that occurs between the "<--" "-->").
          This information is currently dropped during the parsing of the XDF file.
          This would seem to be the correct thing to do; machine readable comments ought
          to be placed in an appropriate node, e.g. parameter, note or attribute
          (such as "description").

        - Clean up debugging messages. Improve and make consistent error messaging 
          within the package. Missing any Exception classes?
