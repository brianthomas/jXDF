   within this package:

        - Makefile is NOT nmake (the W32 make utility) ready. Must currently compile
          each class "by hand" ugh. 

        - Log configuration doesnt appear to allow writing to System.err.

        - XDF::DOM is not yet internet ready. Specifically the newLine entitys are converted
          to spaces by the internal double-parsing of the document. This means that delimited
          data will not be correctly read in (or written out) by the XDF::DOM at this time.
          Look to the XDF-018 version for a fix for this.

        - This may work, but it hasnt been specifically checked:
          When axisValues havent been specifically assigned, written data should
          show empty ones, rather than dropping them. For example, take a 1D array that
          is of size 3. The axis only has values assigned to dataCube indices 0, 2, therefore
          the output XML should look like:
          <axis>
             ...
             <value>one</value>
             <value></value>
             <value>three</value>
          </axis>
 
        - problem carrying over some parameter entities from the DTD.

        - Automatic Unique Id generation may fail when a later node has an id that matches
          a machine generated one on an earlier node. We need a final pass thru the Id 
          stacks to enforce uniqueness in objects (or better yet internal checking of ids to
          enforce unique id's between like nodes).

        - Treatment of XML comments (the stuff in an XML file that occurs between 
          the "<--" "-->").
          This information is currently dropped during the parsing of the XDF file.
          This would seem to be the correct thing to do; machine readable comments ought
          to be placed in an appropriate node, e.g. parameter, note or attribute
          (such as "description").

        - If the user improperly specifies Axis sizes/values, the Reader will overwrite
          prior cells without warning. Better warning messages are needed.

        - Determination of the byte ordering is assumed to apply equally across 
          integers and floats. We have established that this is indeed the case for
          several archetectures, Intel, Sparc, Alpha and SGI, however, I dont know
          for a fact that this is uniformly true for ALL computer archetechures. 
          I list this as a bug simply to warn the user that this could be a major
          problem in the portability and fidelity of binary data.
          I am unaware of other constraints on portability of binary data, however,
          Im sure they exist. At this time, my recomendation is to _avoid the binary 
          data format_ if you worry at all about contaminated data (-b.t.).
