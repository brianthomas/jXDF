	We are planning better support than what is given below,
	however, I just havent had the time to compile the code
	under a broad series of platforms, only Linux is truely tested.
	Good Luck. -b.t.


	To compile the code (UNIX) type :
        =-===========================

	make 

	This will create the xdf.jar file, and HTML API documentation
	(in the doc directory).


	To compile under Windows/MSDOS:
        =-===========================

	You may have luck using NMAKE on NT/W98 systems with the 
	make file (this is untested, so it may not work).

	In a DOS shell in the unpacked directory type:

	> nmake 

	This *should* create the xdf.jar file, and HTML API documentation.
