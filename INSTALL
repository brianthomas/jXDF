	This package is designed for use under Java 1.2.2. It shouldnt
	have any problems running under 1.3, but let me know if thats
	not the case.
	
	You will need a SAX level 1 parser and the org.xml.sax package
	to run this software.  Perhaps there are other locations to 
	acquire this, but I know of but one at SUN: 

	Java API for XML Parsing 1.0.1 may be downloaded at the URL 
        http://java.sun.com/xml/download.html 

	Instructions on install: well, we are planning to better instruct
	you than what is given below, however, I just havent had the time 
	to compile the code under a broad series of platforms, only Linux 
	is truely tested (but one developer regularly runs this code under
	windows).

	Good Luck. -b.t.


	To compile the code (UNIX) type :
        =-===========================

	make 

	This will create the xdf.jar file, and HTML API documentation
	(in the doc directory).


	To compile under Windows/MSDOS:
        =-===========================

	You may have luck using NMAKE on NT/W98 systems with the 
	make file (this is untested, so it may not work).

	In a DOS shell in the unpacked directory type:

	> nmake 

	This *should* create the xdf.jar file, and HTML API documentation. 
	Let me know if you have problems, or better yet, send me a patch
	so it will work ;)
