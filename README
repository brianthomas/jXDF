   About this package.
   ------------------

	This is an alpha release. This means that not all forseen
	functionality has yet been implemented and that we reserve
	the right to significantly revise the API.

	As you might guess, this package is currently under heavy 
	construction. That said, a subset of the final forseen 
	functionality of the package is fairly well implemented. 

	The stability and features of the java objects is good, the 
	main lack remains in the IO portion of the package. At this 
	time it is possible to create java XDF structure objects from
	both delimited and tagged ASCII data (of any dimensionality).
	Binary data is not currently implemented, nor are formatted
       	read/write functionality. Delimited writes work unless newline
	returns are used as either a delimiter or recordTerminator
	character.

	Please report bugs, comments to xdf-dev@xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov.

	See the samples directory for sample code, a DTD and xml files.
