   XDF is a project which is now defunct. The code may or may not compile.
   As I have time, I will try to resurrect it with modern libraries.
   I've included the old Readme below as it still contains some useful 
   information. Note that the links/URLs it contains are NOT useful as
   the project stopped getting support some time ago (~2003).

   About XDF
   ---------

   XDF is the "eXtensible Data Format', an XML data format based on general 
   mathematical principles including concepts such as errors, upper limits,
   physical units, alignment of axes, parallel vectors, etc). It is capable
   of handling nearly any species of scientific/mathematical data. Among the 
   benefits of using XML to handle this type of data is the possibility of 
   using a single format from data source (instrument) to the scientist, to 
   the journal publication, to data centers, and to the public. The aim of 
   XDF is to provides all of the needed constructs within XML to accomplish 
   this goal. 

   See the XDF homepage for more information about XDF:

   About this package.
   ------------------

   This package is designed to provide an IO layer for XDF objects, and is 
   written for the XDF version 0.18 standard (http://xml.gsfc.nasa.gov/DTD/XDF_018.dtd). 
   This software will read/write XDF objects to/from disk. XDF objects 
   themselves contain all the hooks needed to access/manipulate information 
   within the XDF model.  

   This package is an alpha release. This means that only some of the foreseen 
   functionality has been implemented, and, of course, many, many bugs may 
   remain.  Note that we reserve the right to significantly revise the API as 
   need suits us, and that this *is* likely (heh, its 'alpha' after all!!), so 
   please beware!  It hardly needs to be said, but DONT go build production 
   code on top of this software (until its more stable).

   This code is released under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE and is 
   freeware.  Please refer to the LICENSE file included in this distribution 
   for more information on the terms of this license.

   To use the XDF package you will need to have/acquire the following: 

       A. A Java distribution of 1.4.x or higher

            - OR -

       B. A Java distribution of 1.3.x or higher 
                 - AND -
          the JAXP package series 1.1.x (NOT the 1.2 series!!) 

   JAXP is the "Java Processing for XML Package" which "supports processing of 
   XML documents using DOM, SAX, and XSLT". JAXP (1.1.x series) includes the 
   Crimson parser which is the default XML parser for XDF. (JAXP and Crimson
   come as part of the Java 1.4.x series distribution already). The JAXP 
   package is available from SUN: 

       http://java.sun.com/xml/

   WARNING: BE SURE to get the "Fall01" pack which has the older JAXP 1.1.x 
   series. DONT download the "Spring02" pack (it lacks the Crimson parser). 
   (BTW, As far as the Java 1.3 series go, I have found luck using both the 
   SUN and IBM versions with the XDF package.) 
       
   As of this release we now support the JAXP interface for the XDF DOM. The
   XDF DOM comprises a series of 'add-on' classes which allow you to read/write
   and easily manipulate any XML document that contains XDF. Both the Crimson
   and the Xerces1 DOM implementations are now working (Xerces2 exists, but is
   quite buggy). In order to use the Xerces1 version of the XDF DOM, you will 
   need to download the Xerces-J (version 1, of course) package from the 
   Apache folks at: 

            http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j/

   IMPORTANT: see the INSTALL file before proceeding. Also PLEASE 
   NOTE: this is OPTIONAL. You can proceed happily to use the XDF DOM classes 
   in gov.nasa.gsfc.adc.xdf.DOMCrimson without downloading Xerces-J at all.

   The XDF package is currently somewhat stable, with only infrequent modification 
   to the interface of available classes.  Nevertheless, this package is NOT 
   mature (yet), and we are still chasing down bugs. Please keep this in mind 
   if you are considering the adoption of this software for production environments.

   This package supports SAX1 parsing (e.g. no namespaces). SAX2 and schema 
   will be supported as soon as these become comfortably mature.

   For more details on missing features/problems that remain in the package 
   please refer to the TODO file.

   Please report bugs, patches, comments and feature requests to 

           xdf-dev@xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov.
