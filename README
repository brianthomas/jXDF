   About this package.
   ------------------

	This is a beta release. This means that all forseen
	functionality has been implemented, but many bugs may remain. Note
        that we reserve the right to significantly revise the API as
        need suits us.

	This code is released under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 	and is freeware. Please refer to the GPL.TXT file included
	in this distribution for more information on the terms of 
	this license.

        To use the XDF package you will need to acquire the Java API 
        for XML Processing (JAXP) Package (version 1.1) which provides 
        the functionality for reading, manipulating, and generating 
        XML documents that are the basis of XDF.
        The JAXP package is available from SUN (http://developer.java.sun.com
        or http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/earlyAccess/xml/ if you
        can login already as Java Sun developer) which includes the crimson parser
        which is the default XML parser for XDF. Note that XDF allows
        you to use any other SAX2 compliant XML parser (such as Xerces
        from the Apache project; http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j/index.html)
        which do not ship with JAXP.

	As you might guess from its name this package is currently somewhat
        stable, with only infreqent modification to the interface of
        available classes. Nevertheless, this package is NOT mature (yet),
        and we are still chasing down bugs. Please keep this in mind if you are 
        considering the adoption of this software for production enviroments.

	This package supports SAX1 parsering (e.g. no namespaces). SAX2 
        and schema will be supported as soon as these become comfortably 
        mature W3C recogmendations. 

	For more details on missing features/problems that remain in 
	the package please refer to the TODO file.

	Please report bugs, patches, comments and feature requests to 
        xdf-dev@xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov.

	See the samples directory for sample code, a DTD and xml files.

  CVS Repository and Guest FTP Access
  -----------------------------------

	Read only access to the nightly snapshot is allowed for people who
	have downloaded this code once from the main site. The CVS account
	is "guest" which has a password "gu3stacc3ss". The XDF java package
     	directory is "xml/XDF/Java_Package" and the CVSROOT directory is 
	"/home/cvsadmin/src". Here is an example of how you can use this 
	information to obtain a nightly CVS snapshot (UNIX tcsh):

	> setenv CVSROOT :pserver:guest@xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov:/home/cvsadmin/src

 	> cvs login
	    (this will ask for a password, which is "gu3stacc3ss")

	> cvs checkout xml/XDF/Java_Package 

	Note that you only have to use "cvs login" step ONCE. Thereafter, only
	the last step is needed to obtain a copy from CVS.

	Access to the nightly snapshot via FTP is via the "guest" account is also
        available from xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov. Use your email address as a password to
        log in.
