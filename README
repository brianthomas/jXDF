   About XDF
   ---------

        XDF is the "eXtensible Data Format', an XML data format based on general 
        mathematical principles including concepts such as errors, upper limits,
        physical units, alignment of axes, parallel vectors, etc). It is capable
        of handling nearly any species of scientific/mathematical data. Among the 
        benefits of using XML to handle this type of data is the possibility of 
        using a single format from data source (instrument) to the scientist, to 
        the journal publication, to data centers, and to the public. The aim of 
        XDF is to provides all of the needed constructs within XML to accomplish 
        this goal. See the XDF homepage for more information about XDF:

   About this package.
   ------------------

        This package is designed to provide an IO layer for XDF objects. It will
        read/write XDF objects to disk. XDF objects themselves contain all the 
        hooks needed to access/manipulate information within the XDF model.  

	This package is a beta release. This means that all foreseen functionality 
        has been implemented, but many bugs may remain. Note that we reserve the 
        right to significantly revise the API as need suits us.

	This code is released under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE and is 
        freeware.  Please refer to the LICENSE file included in this distribution 
        for more information on the terms of this license.

        To use the XDF package you will need to acquire a version of Java equal or
        greater to 1.3.0 (we have heard that it works for 1.2 but cannot verify) and
        the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) Package (version 1.1) which provides 
	the functionality for reading, manipulating, and generating XML documents that 
        are the basis of XDF.  The JAXP package is available from SUN: 

            http://developer.java.sun.com 

        or 

            http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/earlyAccess/xml/ 

        Use the later URL if you can login already as Java Sun developer. JAXP 
        includes the crimson parser which is the default XML parser for XDF.
      	You will also need to acquire the Xerces-J (version 1.4.3, not the upcoming 2) 
        package from 

            http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j/

        in order to use the classes in the sub-package: gov.nasa.gsfc.adc.xdf.DOM package.

        Furthermore, we *only* support Xerces-1.4.3, so please download that version,
	and YOU WILL NEED TO APPLY A PATCH: ElementState.java.patch (included in this
        distribution) to the relevant Xerces class ElementState AND REBUILD the Xerces 
        distribution (not difficult). Having to patch the Xerces distribution is unfortunate, 
        however, the patch has been submitted to the Xerces-J mailing list, and hopefully it will
	find its way into the next version of Xerces-J.

        The XDF package is currently somewhat stable, with only infrequent modification 
        to the interface of available classes.  Nevertheless, this package is NOT 
        mature (yet), and we are still chasing down bugs. Please keep this in mind 
        if you are considering the adoption of this software for production environments.

	This package supports SAX1 parsing (e.g. no namespaces). SAX2 and schema 
        will be supported as soon as these become comfortably mature W3C 
        recommendations. 

	For more details on missing features/problems that remain in the package 
        please refer to the TODO file.

	Please report bugs, patches, comments and feature requests to 

           xdf-dev@xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov.

	See the samples directory for sample code, a DTD and xml files.


  CVS Repository and Guest FTP Access
  -----------------------------------

	Read only access to the nightly snapshot is allowed for people who have 
        downloaded this code once from the main site. The CVS account is "guest" 
        which has a password "gu3stacc3ss". The XDF Java package directory is 
        "xml/XDF/Java_Package" and the CVSROOT directory is "/home/cvsadmin/src". 
        Here is an example of how you can use this information to obtain a nightly 
        CVS snapshot (UNIX tcsh):

	> setenv CVSROOT :pserver:guest@xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov:/home/cvsadmin/src

 	> cvs login
	    (this will ask for a password, which is "gu3stacc3ss")

	> cvs checkout xml/XDF/Java_Package 

	Note that you only have to use "cvs login" step ONCE. Thereafter, only
	the last step is needed to obtain a copy from CVS.

	Access to the nightly snapshot via FTP is via the "guest" account is also
        available from xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov. Use your email address as a password to
        log in.
