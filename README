   About this package.
   ------------------

	This is an alpha release. This means that not all forseen
	functionality has yet been implemented and that we reserve
	the right to significantly revise the API.

	This code is released under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 	and is freeware. Please refer to the GPL.TXT file included
	in this distribution for more information on the terms of 
	this license.

	As you might guess, this package is currently under heavy 
	construction. That said, a subset of the final forseen 
	functionality of the package is fairly well implemented. 

	The stability and features of the java objects is good, the 
	main lack remains in the IO portion of the package. At this 
	time it is possible to create java XDF structure objects from
	both delimited and tagged ASCII data (of any dimensionality).
	Binary data is not currently implemented, nor is the formatted
       	read/write functionality. Delimited writes work unless newline
	returns are used as either a delimiter or recordTerminator
	character.

	For more details on missing features/problems that remain in 
	the package please refer to the TODO file.

	Please report bugs, patches, comments and feature requests to 
        xdf-dev@xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov.

	See the samples directory for sample code, a DTD and xml files.

  CVS Repository Access
  ---------------------

	Read only access to the nightly snapshot is allowed for people who
	have downloaded this code once from the main site. The CVS account
	is "guest" which has a password "gu3stacc3ss". The XDF java package
     	directory is "xml/XDF/Java_Package" and the CVSROOT directory is 
	"/home/cvsadmin/src". Here is an example of how you can use this 
	information to obtain a nightly CVS snapshot (UNIX tcsh):

	> setenv CVSROOT :pserver:guest@xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov:/home/cvsadmin/src

 	> cvs login
	    (this will ask for a password, which is "gu3stacc3ss")

	> cvs checkout xml/XDF/Java_Package 

	Note that you only have to use "cvs login" step ONCE. Thereafter, only
	the last step is needed to obtain a copy from CVS.
