   About this package.
   ------------------

	This is an alpha release. This means that not all forseen
	functionality has yet been implemented and that we reserve
	the right to significantly revise the API.

	This code is released under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 	and is freeware. Please refer to the GPL.TXT file included
	in this distribution for more information on the terms of 
	this license.

        To use the XDF package you will need to acquire the org.xml.sax 
        package. The SAX package ships with a simple non-validating
	(and fast) parser from SUN, however, you may use other XML
 	parsers with XDF if you so choose (we use Xerces from the 
        apache project). 

	As you might guess, this package is currently under heavy 
	construction. That said, a subset of the final forseen 
	functionality of the package is fairly well implemented. 

	The stability and features of the java objects is good, the 
	main lack remains in the IO portion of the package. At this 
	time it is possible to create java XDF structure objects from
	all supported types of ASCII data (of any dimensionality).
	Binary data is not currently implemented.

	This package supports SAX1 parsers. SAX2 and schema will be 
	supported as soon as these become comfortably mature W3C
        recogmendations. 

	For more details on missing features/problems that remain in 
	the package please refer to the TODO file.

	Please report bugs, patches, comments and feature requests to 
        xdf-dev@xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov.

	See the samples directory for sample code, a DTD and xml files.

  CVS Repository and Guest FTP Access
  -----------------------------------

	Read only access to the nightly snapshot is allowed for people who
	have downloaded this code once from the main site. The CVS account
	is "guest" which has a password "gu3stacc3ss". The XDF java package
     	directory is "xml/XDF/Java_Package" and the CVSROOT directory is 
	"/home/cvsadmin/src". Here is an example of how you can use this 
	information to obtain a nightly CVS snapshot (UNIX tcsh):

	> setenv CVSROOT :pserver:guest@xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov:/home/cvsadmin/src

 	> cvs login
	    (this will ask for a password, which is "gu3stacc3ss")

	> cvs checkout xml/XDF/Java_Package 

	Note that you only have to use "cvs login" step ONCE. Thereafter, only
	the last step is needed to obtain a copy from CVS.

	Access to the nightly snapshot via FTP is via the "guest" account is also
        available from xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov. Use your email address as a password to
        log in.
